					%p.drama Growing up in the Nognog Rocky Place, my love of nature long preceded my love of photography. Being part of a family that appreciated and explored the outdoors helped me learn to appreciate and enjoy the landscape. Today I spend as much time as I can in nature hiking, backpacking, and wakeboarding. I enjoy traveling to new and exotic locations, especially to new mountain ranges. I would rather visit a jagged peak way off the map than struggle with crowds in a city any day. For me, photography is really just a by-product of spending so much time in nature. I think that spending time in the wilderness is just about the best thing one can do. I find a deep spirituality in nature and I hope for it to become evident in my photography. I put a lot of effort into these images and I hope that my passion for traveling and nature can translate into something special for the viewer. I also have a facebook page that contains lots of photographs and the stories behind them. Enjoy looking at my images!

					%p.note Artists Statement

					%p.aiming I aim to photograph the landscape in a way that will help others appreciate and care for it. I hope to express the deep spirituality that I find in nature and to bring back images to people that might not otherwise have an opportunity to witness the beauty.
